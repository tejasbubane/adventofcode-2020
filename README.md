# Advent Of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I am playing with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) :crab: these days so that is the language I will use for for this year's AOC :tada:

### Usage

This is a library crate (no executable). [Sample and puzzle input files](tests/inputs) are passed to tests directly.

Build project and run tests:

```
cargo test
```
