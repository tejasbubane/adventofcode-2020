My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I am playing with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) :crab: these days so that is the language I will use for for this year's AOC :tada:

### Usage

This is a library crate (no executable). Sample and puzzle inputs are hard-coded in tests.

Build project and run tests:
```
cargo test
```
